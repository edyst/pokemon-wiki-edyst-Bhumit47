        franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken
        Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, and
        the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred as the

            The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that
            discussion. In the process of getting out their doors and visiting
            parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of
            themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that
            he'd lost 65 pounds between July and December.

      <div>
      <p class="temp marg">1.What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</p>
      <ul class="marg">
        <li>
          We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite
          well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but
          you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain.
          Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also
          capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped
          into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all
          Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.
        </li>
        <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="temp marg">2.What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</p>
        <div>
        <ul class="marg">
        <li>
          <p>
            Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you
            start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if
            you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who
            emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon
            game, you've reached the point where you're presented with the most
            effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no
            button mashing at all is required.
          </p>

        <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>
